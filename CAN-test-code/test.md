## Testing

Fill in the ```checkpoint``` (pretrained model path) in the config file ```config.yaml``` and test with the CROHME dataset:

```
python inference.py --dataset CROHME
```

## About checkpoints and test data
We do not release all checkpoints trained with our dataset, you need to be familiar with the training process and testing process of CAN. For details, you can refer to its [readme](README.md) file.

If you want to test our method on CAN, any question please sent our e-mail.
